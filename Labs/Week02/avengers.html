The Avengers is a team of superheroes, appearing in comic books published by <strong>Marvel Comics</strong>. The team made its debut in <em>The Avengers #1</em> (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor <strong>Stan Lee</strong> and artist/co-plotter <strong>Jack Kirby</strong>, following the trend of super-hero teams after the success of DC Comics' Justice League of America.

	<h2>Comics</h2>
Labeled <em>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em>, the Avengers originally consisted of <strong>Iron Man, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Thor, and the Hulk</strong>. The original Captain America was discovered, trapped in ice (issue #4), and joined the group after they revived him. A rotating roster became a hallmark, although one theme remained consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand." The team, famous for its battle cry of <em>"Avengers Assemble!"</em>, has featured humans, mutants, robots, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.

	<h2>Films</h2>
The 2012 live-action feature film <em>The Avengers</em>, directed by <strong>Joss Whedon</strong>, set numerous records during its box office run, including the biggest opening debut in North America, with a weekend gross of $207.4 million. A second Avengers film titled <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> is set for release on May 1, 2015.

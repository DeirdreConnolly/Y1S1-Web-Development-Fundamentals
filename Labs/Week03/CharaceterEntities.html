			<h1>Example of Special Characters (HTML Entities) in a Web Page</h1>
			<p>Seán and Sinéad are saving up for a trip abroad; they are planning on visiting Áine who
			is studying at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.  They plan on bringing a 
			gift and decided that they will both pay ½ of the cost, however Mícheál asked if he could 
			contribute towards the gift too and they will now pay 1/3 each, they have agreed on a 
			total budget of €75 for the gift.  Sinéad has suggested they try the new shop 
			“Gifts & More” as there are great bargains advertised for this shop.</p>


			<p>As they looked over the online catalogue for the shop, they came across the symbols for copyright ©, registered ® and trademark ™.  
			These symbols were new to them and as they were studying HTML they decided to look up the codes for these so as to enter them on a web page.</p>
			
			<p>Registered code = &reg;</p>
			<p>Trademark code = &trade;</p>
